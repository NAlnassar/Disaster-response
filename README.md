# Disaster Message Classifier

This repository contains a model for classifying disaster messages, along with the necessary data used for training and a web application to interact with the trained model.

Feel free to read my [Blog Post!](https://medium.com/@alnassarnasser/disaster-message-classifier-1234567890)

## Quickstart

> [!NOTE]
> When using pandas, make sure to check what the actual methods and functions are doing. Go step by step and print every step along the way; you will save yourself a lot of headaches!
> To Run the web application write the following: `python run.py`

### Installation

Install the required libraries by running the following command:
`pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Libraries Used in the Repository

- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/): A data manipulation library for Python, providing data structures and functions for efficiently handling and analyzing **structured** data.
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/): A fundamental package for scientific computing with Python, supporting arrays, matrices, and tools needed for machine learning tasks and scientific projects in general.
- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/): A versatile machine learning library for Python, featuring various algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, along with utilities for model evaluation and data preprocessing. Even though it is pretty high-level compared to PyTorch or TensorFlow, it gets the job done.
- [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/): NLTK is a Python library for natural language processing tasks. It offers tools for text processing, such as tokenization and tagging.
